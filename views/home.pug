        h1.bodyStyle Hi! I'm Doug.
        h3.bodyStyle I'm a software engineer. My goal is to constantly improve and refine my skillset, and write beautiful code while I'm at it. 
        h3.bodyStyle I'm also a proud Virginia Tech Grad (Go Hokies!) and Virginian turned North Carolinian. I currently live and work in the Research Triagle region of North Carolina (and loving every second of it!)
        h3.bodyStyle If you are in need of a full stack web developer, or maybe you just want to talk coffee or cars, please don't hesitate to reach out. Find my resume or shoot me an email below.
